As examples, the works of  and , and most early silent films, are in the public domain either by virtue of their having been created before copyright existed, or by their copyright term having expired. Some works are not covered by copyright, and are therefore in the public domain—among them the formulae of Newtonian physics, cooking recipes, and all computer software  created prior to 1974. Other works are actively dedicated by their authors to the public domain (see waiver); some examples include reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms, the image-processing software ImageJ (created by the National Institutes of Health), and the CIA's . The term  is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights, in which case use of the work is referred to as "under license" or "with permission".
As rights vary by country and jurisdiction, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country. The term "public domain" may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "" or "", including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".
Although the term "domain" did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept can be traced back to the ancient , “as a preset system included in the property right system." The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined "many things that cannot be privately owned" as , ,  and . The term  was defined as things not yet appropriated. The term  was defined as "things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind, such as air, sunlight and ocean." The term  referred to things that were shared by all citizens, and the term  meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome. When looking at it from a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of "public domain" sprouted from the concepts of , , and  in early Roman law.
When the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the  in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century. Instead of "public domain", they used terms such as  or  to describe works that were not covered by copyright law.
The phrase "fall in the public domain" can be traced to mid-19th century France to describe the end of . The French poet  equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling "into the sink hole of  public domain" and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as , , and , expire or are abandoned. In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a, "little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain." Copyright law differs by country, and the American legal scholar  has described the public domain as being "different sizes at different times in different countries".
Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space; that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law. According to  this definition underlines common usage of the term  and equates the public domain to  and works in copyright to . However, the usage of the term  can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by . Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to  rights and limitation on ownership. A conceptual definition comes from Lange, who focused on what the public domain should be: "it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression, a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression". Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a "territory", but rather as a concept: "[T]here are certain materials – the air we breathe, sunlight, rain, space, life, creations, thoughts, feelings, ideas, words, numbers – not subject to private ownership. The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival." The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "" or "", including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".
A public-domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired or have been forfeited.
In most countries the  of copyright expires on the first day of January, 70 years after the death of the latest living author. The longest copyright term is in Mexico, which has life plus 100 years for all deaths since July 1928.
A notable exception is the United States, where every book and tale published prior to 1925 is in the public domain; American copyrights last for 95 years for books written between 1925 and 1978.
For example: the works of , , ,  and  are in the public domain worldwide as they all died over 100 years ago.

People have been creating music for millennia. The first  system, the  system, was created 4000 years ago.  introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century. This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducibility have led to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.
U.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file. Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1922 is considered public domain. Sound recordings, on the other hand, are subject to different rules and are not eligible for public domain status until 2021–2067, depending on the date and location of publishing.
The  project records music in the public domain for the purposes of making the music available to the general public in a high-quality audio format. Online musical archives preserve collections of classical music recorded by Musopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service. 
A  is a  that was released to public domain by its author or because its  has expired. In 2016 there are more than 2,000 films on public domain in every genre, from musicals to romance, horror to animated movies and noir to western movies.
Pamela Samuelson has identified eight "values" that can arise from information and works in the public domain.
Possible values include:
Derivative works include , , and  of a work, as well as other forms of transformation or adaptation. Copyrighted works may not be used for derivative works without permission from the copyright owner, while public domain works can be freely used for derivative works without permission. Artworks that are public domain may also be reproduced photographically or artistically or used as the basis of new, interpretive works. Works derived from public domain works can be copyrighted.
Once works enter into the public domain, derivative works such as adaptations in book and film may increase noticeably, as happened with 's novel , which became public domain in the U.S. in 1977 and most of the rest of the world in 1995. By 1999, the plays of Shakespeare, all public domain, had been used in more than 420 feature-length films. In addition to straightforward adaptation, they have been used as the launching point for transformative retellings such as 's  and 's . Marcel Duchamp's  is a derivative of Leonardo da Vinci's , one of thousands of derivative works based on the public domain painting.
Some works may never fully lapse into the public domain. A perpetual  is held for the  of the Bible in the UK.
While the copyright has expired for the Peter Pan works by  (the play   and the novel ) in the United Kingdom, it was granted a special exception under the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988 (Schedule 6) that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances, publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK, as long as  (to whom Barrie gave the copyright) continues to exist.
In a  regime, works that have entered the public domain after their copyright has expired, or traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions that have never been subject to copyright, are still subject to royalties payable to the state or to an authors' association. The user does not have to seek permission to copy, present or perform the work, but does have to pay the fee. Typically the royalties are directed to support of living artists.
The  proposed in 2010 the  (PDM) as  to indicate that a work is free of known  restrictions and therefore in the public domain. The public domain mark is analogous to the , which acts as . The  databases use it, and for instance on the  in February 2016 2.9 million works (~10% of all works) are listed as .
The underlying idea that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law (see ). Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.
Works created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example,  and the inventions of  are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.
Determination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.
In the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because  have been extended multiple times and in different ways—shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with , to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.  The claim that "pre-1925 works are in the public domain" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.
In most other countries that are signatories to the , copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See .)
Legal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the  was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the , which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based .  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements—a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.
 and various other governments are excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries. They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well. The legal scholar Melville Nimmer has written that "it is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright, even when incorporated into a copyrighted work".
Before 1988 in the US, works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit . With the  Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier , which went into effect in 1978), all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a  statement/. Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain, e.g.  of . This may even "effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly ".
An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public. Real public domain makes  unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission (""). There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain. In 2000 the  was released as a public domain like . In 2009 the  released the , which was created for  with law domains which have no concept of . This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license, in case the waiver is not possible. The , published around 2010, has a focus on an  message. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution. Another option is the , released in 2006 and aimed to software.
In October 2014 the  recommends the Creative Commons  license to dedicate content to the public domain, and the  for data.
In most countries, the term of rights for patents is 20 years, after which the invention becomes part of the public domain. In the United States, the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for 20 years from the date of filing within the United States or 20 years from the earliest date of filing if under 35 USC 120, 121, or 365(c). However, the  and any  within a patent, provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the "personality" of the person drawing them, are not subject to copyright protection. This is separate from the  rights just mentioned.
A trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely, or expire without specific regard to its age. For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become , and therefore part of the public domain.
Because trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug "acetylsalicylic acid" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as  in the United States—a generic term. In Canada, however, "Aspirin", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company , while aspirin, with a lowercase "a", is not. Bayer lost the trademark in the United States, the UK and France after World War I, as part of the . So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later.
Bayer also lost the trademark in the same jurisdictions for "Heroin" which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin.
Although  resigned itself to genericide, it has fought attempts by other companies to register "" as a  .
Public Domain Day is an observance of when  expire and works enter into the public domain. This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on 1 January based on the individual .
The observance of a "Public Domain Day" was initially informal; the earliest known mention was in 2004 by Wallace McLean (a Canadian public domain activist), with support for the idea echoed by . As of 1 January 2010 a Public Domain Day website lists the authors whose works are entering the public domain. There are activities in countries around the world by various organizations all under the banner Public Domain Day.
