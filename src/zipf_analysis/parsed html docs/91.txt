She said her husband's response was in fear and he was "profoundly sorry" and meant no one harm. "I, too, am sorry if anybody was harmed," said the visibly shaken prosecutor. "It's never my intent to harm any protester. I just want to live in peace and do my job."Los Angeles police will investigate the incident and, "if appropriate, bring to an independent prosecutor's office for review," the district attorney's office said in a statement. Melina Abdullah, an activist and professor of Pan African Studies at Cal State LA, said going to Lacey's house on the eve of the election was their way of trying to take Lacey up on her word to meet with the group.Lacey said she had offered to meet with Black Lives Matter representatives in the past, but "felt it should be one-on-one or a small group. They have rejected those offers," Lacey said."We've attempted to go to her office. She has refused to engage the public," Abdullah said, maintaining that the group did not cross the line by going to Lacey's home."I do not believe it is fair or right for protesters to show up at the homes of people who dedicate their lives to public service," Lacey said.
