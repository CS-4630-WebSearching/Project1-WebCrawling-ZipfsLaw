https://www.wcvb.com/article/horses-living-in-piles-of-manure-rescued-woman-faces-animal-cruelty-charges/31154966A Ludlow woman is facing animal cruelty charges after two horses were found living in stalls with piles of manure so high that the animals’ backs were pressed against the barn roof rafters, causing sores, the MSPCA said.On Feb. 5, a team from the MSPCA spent two hours digging the horses out of their stalls because the manure blocked the doors.  The animals are now being cared for by the  in Methuen.  Nancy L. Golec of Ludlow, the former owner of the horses, has been charged with four counts of felony animal cruelty.  Golec was arraigned in Palmer District Court on Feb. 24.  The horses—a 13-year-old Arabian named Shakira and an 11-year-old Quarter Horse/Arabian cross named Tia—were surrendered and taken by the MSPCA's equine ambulance to Nevins Farm. Once extracted from the stalls in which they had been trapped, the sores on their backs — a result of standing on piles of manure so high that their backs were pressed into the building's rafters — were made plainly visible, the MSPCA said.Roger Lauze, the equine rescue training manager at Nevins Farm, said he hasn't seen such neglect in nearly 40 years of working in horse rescue."The hooves on these horses were so overgrown and disfigured that it will take years of farrier work for them to reshape — if that's even possible," he said. Both horses had overgrown teeth, with hind legs that were caked in manure.Tia is underweight, an additional sign that she had been neglected for years, the MSPCA said.Their overgrown and misshapen hooves contributed to imbalances that have significantly impacted their health.  “We’re going to do everything possible to help them live the rest of their lives without pain, but that will be determined by the degree to which we can reshape the hooves,” said Lauze.  X-rays confirmed changes to the coffin bones of both of Shakira’s front hooves, but the staff are hopeful these changes will not further erode the quality of her life, the MSPCA said.  “It really depends on the extent to which her hooves can be reshaped,” added Lauze.Tia’s radiographs, however, show immense deformation of the coffin bones in her hind hooves, among other bone changes that could forever compromise her health.  The Nevins Farm team will continue to rehabilitate both horses in hopes that they can be placed for adoption.  Anyone interested in adopting can email  for more information.

											HAD SUFFERED SERIOUS DEFORMITIES. >> YOU CAN SEE THEY’RE BRIGHT EYED, EARS ARE UP, WHICH MEANS THEY’RE HAPPY. SERA: HAPPY AND ON THEIR WAY TO BEING HEALTHY. SHAKIRA AND TIA ARE RECOVERING AT THE NEVINS FARM IN METHUEN AFTER BEING RESCUED FROM TORTUROUS CONDITIONS. >> I’VE NEVER HAD TO DIG A HORSE OUT OF A BARN. SERA: IN EARLY FEBRUARY, THE PAIR WAS RESCUED BY THE MSPCA FROM A LDLOW FARM, TRAPPED IN THEIR STALLS BY DEEP PILES OF MANURE. THEIR BACKS HAD SORES FROM RUBBING AGAINST THE RAFTERS. >> OH, THIS IS THE WORST. SERA: ROGER LAUZE SAYS IT’S THE WORST CASE OF NEGLECT HE’S SEEN IN HIS 40-YEAR CAREER. >> WHEN I FIRST WENT THERE, WHAT WAS THROUGH MY MIND WAS HOW COULD SOMEBODY DO THIS? I DON’T UNDERSTAND IT, I DON’T KNOW HOW SOMEBODY CAN DO THIS. SERA: THE MOST DAMAGING RESULT -- THEIR HOOVES WERE ALLOWED TO GROW OUT OF CONTROL, MAKING IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK AND LEADING TO BONE DEFORMITY. THIS VIDEO OF THE PAIR ARRIVING AT NEVINS FARMS SHOWS THEIR INSTABILITY AND THE TOUGH SHAPE THEY WERE IN. TIA ESPECIALLY IS FACING A DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD. >> OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE HER SOUND ENOUGH TO BE A PASTURE PET TYPE THING. WE’RE NOT SURE SHE’LL BE RIDDEN AGAIN. SHAKIRA, WE HAVE HIGHER HOPES THAT SHE WILL BE RIDDEN AGAIN. SERA: THE OWNER HAS BEEN CRIMINALLY CHARGED AND THE RESCUERS HELPING TIA AND SHAKIRA HEAL ALSO MARVEL AT THEIR RESILIENT SPIRIT. >> NO MATTER WHAT’S BEEN DONE TO THEM, IT DOESN’T CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND HOW THEY REACT TO PEOPLE.
